# Smart Bed MQTT

This project aims to enable remote control of smart beds.

Initial support is for:-
- Sleeptracker AI controlled beds such as the Tempur Ergo Smart Base.

# Sleeptracker Support

The plan is to use the same api used by the iOS and Android apps, so it is possible that this will break if the apps are changed.

I am making good progress in reverse-engineering the API used to communicate with the bed, but if you have a split base bed, or a bed with lumbar/head tilt support please reach out using Issues tab.
